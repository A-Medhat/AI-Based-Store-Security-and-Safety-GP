## Overview

This project focuses on creating a comprehensive security and safety system for retail stores using advanced AI techniques. The system includes two main functionalities:

1. **Real-Time Shoplifting Detection**: Utilizes Inception V3 combined with a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) network to identify suspicious behavior indicative of shoplifting. The system analyzes composite frames using optical flow and Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) for enhanced accuracy.

2. **Real-Time Fire Detection**: Implements the YOLO V8 model to detect fire hazards promptly and accurately, ensuring swift alerts and responses to potential dangers.

## Features

- **Shoplifting Detection**: 
  - Utilizes Inception V3 and GRU network.
  - Analyzes composite frames via optical flow and HOG.
  - Provides real-time alerts for suspicious behavior.

- **Fire Detection**:
  - Deploys YOLO V8 for rapid fire detection.
  - Ensures timely alerts for fire hazards.

## Technology Stack

- **Deep Learning Models**: Inception V3, GRU, YOLO V8
- **Computer Vision**: Optical Flow, HOG, OpenCV
- **Deployment**: FastAPI
- **Programming Languages**: Python
